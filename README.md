# Creative Kernel

This project provides a unified framework for a modular tool platform for creatives. Specifically, we provide an event-based architecture that operates across hard boundaries.

Individual modules can be
 
- iFrames
- JS scripts running in WASM Modules (thanks to QuickJS)
- Modules in the main runtime
